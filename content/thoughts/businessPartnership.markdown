The beginnings of any business relationship are often what set the tone for the long haul. Agencies and clients alike fall into the trap of rushing into a “pitch for business” mindset without first having a conversation focused on the specific challenges and opportunities.

There are three main pillars to prioritize at the onset of any potential partnership and they are more important than the typical courting dance of capabilities decks, historic case studies and budget estimates: (1) Building Trust, (2) Discussing Opportunities & Challenges and (3) Defining Goals & Objectives.

Maximize a working relationship by starting with active listening
Imagine meeting someone for the first time and as an initial conversation, you start talking about yourself for 30-minutes without a break. This happens in business all the time yet we never call it out as a faux pas.

When agencies or clients take this one-way street approach, they often bypass building trust or practicing active listening, a technique that helps maintain a two-sided conversation. One common misunderstanding is: Active listening means listening patiently until the other person is done talking. This is not correct. Active listening means engaging with your counterpart, asking thoughtful questions and building off of what you hear in response to keep the conversation dynamic.

When we engage actively in conversation and are mindful of building long-term success with our partners, neural coupling is activated. Neural coupling is a process that occurs in the brain during conversation as an emotional connection that gradually develops when individuals talk through ideas and shared experiences. When this occurs at the beginning of a relationship, a foundation is established for teamwork, collaboration and a more effective partnership long-term. Furthermore, it incites creativity and puts both parties into a solution-oriented frame of thought.

How often do we forget to have that two-sided conversation and do not practice active listening at the beginning of a potential partnership?
Here at toddstreet, we explored the psychology behind new business development in a simple three-step process at the onset of a relationship, to yield a more fruitful engagement long-term.

1. BUILD TRUST
   Present yourself as a company other businesses want to work with.
   Building trust is the first step in successful relationships. In fact, when we feel trust and a sense of belonging, we are not only more productive but we retain more information, become excited and seek to maximize this rewarding experience. This is the essence behind engaging minds and inciting action.

Be mindful of the “No trust” disease — Stop over-talking about yourself. It can be hard to relate when you TELL someone something. People trust when they are given equal time to talk and discuss, and that should always happen at the beginning of the conversation. Not after a presentation.
Bring your team and culture into the conversation — People want to work with other people and not the idea of your business. The people in your company are the differentiators and their talents, personalities and backgrounds are hard to convey in a deck. Find a way to share your team’s personality.
“Your employees aren’t just representing your company. They’re representing your clients’ brands.”

2. DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES & CHALLENGES
   Discuss your ideas of what good looks like.
   Get on the same page so that you set the right expectations.

Understand the Opportunities and Challenges First — Practice active listening and stay strategic in your questions. Build on top of what you’ve heard and reiterate if something does not make sense or click right away.
Avoid the Case Studies Dilemma — Every situation is unique and the way you did it for previous clients is not how you will do it for future clients. Try not to rely on past case studies and always focus on future solutions that address current challenges as the central point in your discussion.

3. DEFINE GOALS & OBJECTIVES
   Simple takeaways will simplify your next step.
   Recap what you spoke about and analyze some of your takeaways before you part ways. Keep it simple with an action in mind.

Summarize and Set Expectations — Create key takeaways, set expectations and do not rely on minute notes to build your relationship. Recap the specific challenges, maybe some thoughts that crossed your mind that were not said, and plan a follow-up that will be a solutions-oriented discussion.
Commit to something real and actionable — If the commitment after your first meeting is “we will send a deck” or “a quote”— that’s the #1 mistake to setting yourself back to square one. Keep the conversation real and don’t jump into the sales mindset too quickly.
Breath. Listen. Seize those first few moments to get to know each other. The rest will follow naturally. 🤝
