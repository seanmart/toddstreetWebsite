subtitle: Research has shown that a lot of our accepted norms for brainstorming are actually misguided.

The main philosophy behind brainstorming is that there are no dumb ideas and this norm has encouraged wild idea generation and quick thinking in group settings for many years, which can often lead to quantity vs. quality.

It’s become a well-versed process, brought forward in Alex Osborn’s 1940’s book “How to Think Up” that many of us practice yet rarely contemplate. We seldom ask ourselves the question — does the way we brainstorm actually work? Furthermore, what results do we reap when client demands for creative requests are now becoming tighter and tighter?

Most agencies have their own unique tactics on how they prefer to brainstorm. They might do it by Post-it Voting, Four Categories, Bingo Selection, or The How-Now-Wow Matrix. If you’re unfamiliar with these techniques then you may be surprised to see such a wide array of options, thinking “well, we just get in a room together and talk ideas.”

However you choose to brainstorm, you will reach a point in the process when there are enough ideas to start narrowing down, and this is called the convergent stage — the most important part of your group brainstorm.

Yet, we don’t always perceive the convergent stage as the opportunity to take our brainstorm to the next level...

Make or break your brainstorm
It’s time to break the norms. Since we are accustomed to jumping into a room for quick, creative thinking when we think “it’s time to brainstorm,” it’s easy to risk the following:

- Starting out unclear about what the challenge is
- Providing inadequate space for independent thought prior to the start of a brainstorm
- Rushing the process to get as many ideas in as possible
- Falling for the convergence trap of grabbing low-hanging fruit

Below are three key takeaways that can help make the most of your next brainstorm in a time of increasingly tighter deadlines and without the luxury of letting ideas sit for days to percolate.

## 1. Diverge first before you converge.

### Start with a challenge and let individuals work alone, first.

A brainstorm session should always start with ONE specific challenge, not multiple, and that should always be the starting point to the process.

Research suggests that when a person is presented with a challenge and is able to think about it independently, their problem-solving approach will be more unique. When we think of brainstorming, we almost always think groups first, and as a result our thinking and memory becomes diluted based on what someone else says or will say in a group setting.

To ensure unique and diverse input, let individuals work alone first before joining the group. This is called diverging before converging.

## 2. Give wild ideas time.

### When brainstorming, we often rush the creative process.

We gather wild ideas on paper, talk about what works and what doesn’t — the next step is to create a plan. This is where brainstorms often hit a habit-formed roadblock (or trap) known as the creative paradox — or the creadox.

And the reason a lot of us get here is because we don’t give the brainstorm any time to develop or provide adequate time for the convergence stage. Our natural instincts take over to choose the ideas that make most sense, and feel familiar, when we are rushed to make a decision.

The creadox suggests that we choose the safest, lowest risk, or most familiar ideas in the room in what is called the convergence trap — the roadblock for creative breakthrough.

To help slow down the process, The How-Now-Wow Matrix, as mentioned earlier, is a special technique used in brainstorming that steers you away from the convergence trap and allows wild ideas to come to fruition. See below:

- Now/Blue Ideas — Normal ideas, easy to implement.
- How/Yellow Ideas — Original ideas, impossible to implement.
- Wow/Green Ideas — Original ideas, easy to implement.

The How-Now-Wow Matrix is an idea selection tool that breaks the creadox by forcing people to weigh each idea on 2 parameters.

## 3. Consider the executioners in the room.

### Consider the people in working groups that are the types that want closure (factor them into your brainstorming technique.)

Closers often jump to thinking about execution and 8/10 times you will have a ‘closer’ mentality in the room with you for a brainstorm. There are specific techniques you can add to your process that account for these types of people that are high in need for closure by slowing down the creative process and building on ideas rather than quickly working to discard them.

It’s all about the process of association.

To get everyone involved in the process most effectively, have everyone in your group write down their ideas on a card. Then, pass the cards around and have the person next to you build on that idea. Keep passing and building as the cards circulate around the room, up until you get your card back to you.

The process of association now becomes the power of association and of your brainstorm. Now, everyone in the room is able to consider and explore all the ideas suggested.

Consider also utilizing the 6–3–5 Method, a group-structured brainstorming technique where 6 participants supervised by a moderator write down 3 new ideas every 5 minutes and then pass their ideas to the participant to their right. After 6 rounds this can produce 108 completely new ideas which are not diluted by closers or the group mentality.

If you have more or less than six people, practice building on ideas together as a group using the card method, as it motivates everyone (even the closers) to get on the same page and instills patience — something we don’t get enough of these days.

That’s toddstreet’s take on brainstorming for now. Let us know if you have any feedback or wish to brainstorm anything with us. We’ll be sure to practice what we preach!
