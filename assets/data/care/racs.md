While visiting his family over the Holiday period, Laurence, our Creative and Marketing Specialist, spent time volunteering with RACS, the Refugee and Casework Service in Sydney. This inspiring organization provides much needed legal support for refugees and asylum seekers in Australia, "a strong, independent public voice for the rights of refugees and people seeking asylum".

Laurence collaborated with their Marketing and Communications Team to help develop emotional storytelling approaches for their donor communications, developed and reviewed marketing collateral, creatively conceived videos and helped with script writing. Laurence continues to assist RACS throughout 2020. Pictured below he is excitedly being gifted with an official RACS shirt by their Director and Principal Solicitor, Sarah Dale.
