Last Sunday, our very own GeneviÃ¨ve rode 100km in the annual [Velocity Ride](https://www.velocityride.org/)! In just 6 weeks she raised more than $2000 for the Columbia University Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, helping their team gain momentum in the fight against cancer with every pedal pushed along the way!
Congrats GeneviÃ¨ve, and thank you for sweating for a cause so close to toddstreetâ€™s heart. ğŸ’ªğŸš²ğŸ’¨
