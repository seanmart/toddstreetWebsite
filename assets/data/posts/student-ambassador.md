This weekend our Coordinator, Gianna volunteered at the Vans Warped Tour as a Student Ambassador for Full Sail University (her Alma Mater!) Gianna talked to attendees about the university, passed out free swag, facilitated an album signing with Mayday Parade and setup/struck down the booth. toddstreet is all about using our talents to give back to the community, great work Gianna, doing us proud!! 👏🏻
